        <ContributorShortBio>Stella Neumann is a full professor of English Linguistics at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. She holds a degree in translation from Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn and received a PhD in translation studies and a habilitation in English linguistics from Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany. Her research interests include the combination of corpus-linguistic and experimental methods for the empirical modelling of translation as well as quantitative register analysis across varieties of English and across languages. </ContributorShortBio>

        <ContributorName>Čulo, Oliver</ContributorName>
        <ContributorShortBio>Oliver currently holds an Assistant Professor ("Juniorprofessor") position for Translation-relevant Linguistics at the Translation Faculty at Mainz University. He attended Saarland University, where he received his diploma in computational linguistics and his PhD in machine translation. His thesis work focused on developing ways of automatically comparing verb valence between English and German using parallel corpora. During a one-year stay at ICSI at the University of California in Berkeley in 2011 and 2012, he worked with researchers in the FrameNet Project, who are building a lexical database based on frame semantic analyses. He is interested in how grammar and semantics interact in translation. </ContributorShortBio>

	  <Blurb>Exchange between the translation studies and the computational linguistics communities has traditionally not been very intense. Among other things, this is reflected by the different views on parallel corpora. While computational linguistics does not always strictly pay attention to the translation direction (e.g. when translation rules are extracted from (sub)corpora which actually only consist of translations), translation studies are amongst other things concerned with exactly comparing source and target texts (e.g. to draw conclusions on interference and standardization effects). However, there has recently been more exchange between the two fields – especially when it comes to the annotation of parallel corpora. This special issue brings together the different research perspectives. Its contributions show – from both perspectives – how the communities have come to interact in recent years. </Blurb>
